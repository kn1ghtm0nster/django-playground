# Django Interactive Playground (Back-End)

The `Django Interactive Playground` back-end provides a safe, sandboxed environment for new developers to experiment with Django's core features--models, querysets, and relationships--using realistic **FAKE** data.

This backend is designed to power an interactive front-end (**LINK TBD**) and exposes API endpoints for learning and demonstrating purposes.

**WARNING :** This project is intended for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY** and is **NOT** meant for production deployments.
